## Research Interests

My research as a chemical oceanographer focuses on utilising constant flux proxies to investigate trace metal fluxes, particle reactions in the water column, and particle transport. The region of interest for these studies is a meridional transect of the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Antarctica along longitude 152&deg;W.

I am also interested in paleo applications of constant flux proxies to sediment core data for reconstructions of major dust events over the Pacific Ocean.
